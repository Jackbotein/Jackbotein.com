About
</div>
<div class="text" id="leadership">Belveal Law is located on the south side
of the Holton Square, and its two attorneys
have been practicing law for a combined
number of 22 years.
Alexandria Belveal began her apprentice- ship into the law at the age of five when she
followed her father, Edward Dunn, to court
and to meetings. Since that time, Alex has
known that she wanted to be an attorney.
After attending K-State for undergraduate
and Washburn Law School, Alex was fortunate enough to be able to practice alongside
her dad until he passed in 2010. Alex has
lived and worked in Holton all of her life
and has dedicated herself to this community
and to the friends and neighbors who call it
home.
Her practice includes real estate, probate,
adoptions, guardianships, child in need of care and criminal law. Alex is also the county counselor
for Jackson County, acting as legal advisor and attorney to the Jackson County Commissioners and
department heads and directors. Alex even worked as a prosecutor in Jefferson County for a short
time.
Jason Belveal grew up on a small farm just outside of Valley Falls. He attended Highland Community College, Emporia State and Washburn Law. Jason worked for several years in banking,
accounting and finance before going to law school. Jason also served on the Valley Falls city council before attending law school.
Jason worked as a trial lawyer in Topeka for several years before becoming county attorney in
Jefferson County. Today, his primary practice areas include criminal law, domestic and family law
and limited amounts of civil law. Jason has also served as trial counselor for other lawyers and
consults with other lawyers regarding their cases.

W. Fourth St. in Holton.
